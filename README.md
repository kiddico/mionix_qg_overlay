This is a simple replacement for the terrible Overwolf overlay that comes with the Mionix QG mouse. Javascript embedded in an html doc listens to a websocket and displays the results in an arc graph...thing. Using d3.

An example by [tyrope](https://gist.github.com/tyrope/c7cd3ec73e76bef9705d101c110b18e2) is used for the websocket side, and [this](http://ramblings.mcpher.com/Home/excelquirks/bigapps/bigquiz/dashtimer) is used (with modifications) for the display portion.


When functionin properly this is how it looks:

With little effort this can be used in OBS in combination with the browser source.
